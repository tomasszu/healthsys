<p>
The objective of this system is to help unite the Latvian healthcare service employees and patients on a single digital platform, easing the everyday work of the medical and pharmaceutical personnel by digitalizing much of the required operational paperwork, and to overall enable a maximum availability and effectiveness of the Latvian healthcare services. This system will allow doctors to view and contribute to the patients medical history, issue notes and referrals, prescribe medicine, however, the General practitioners will be able to manage their practice as well. The patients will be able to receive all the medical information about themselves, look up doctors and specialists that are available in the system database and the pharmacy personnel will be able to hand out prescription drugs based on a patients available prescriptions, as well as manage the pharmacy’s medicinal inventory and access the state approved medicines database, replacing even the pharmacy’s inner systems. To improve the communication between system users, this system has also a built in messaging service. The System consists of 8 modules: User, Doctors, Referrals, Doctor visits, Drugs, Medical history, Patient and Pharmacist, and was developed in the PHP environment using the Laravel framework. I’ve created the user interface by using vanilla CSS without frameworks.
